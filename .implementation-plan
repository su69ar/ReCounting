# ReCounting Website — Content & SEO Implementation Plan
# Generated: 2026-02-18
# Status: PROPOSED — Awaiting approval before execution

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The ReCounting website (recounting.my.id) has a solid technical foundation but suffers
from critical content gaps. Out of 15 pages, 4 are complete stubs with placeholder text,
2 service pages are bare "Coming Soon" stubs, and the About page has placeholder team data.
Only the Homepage, Services Index, Bookkeeping, Tax Compliance, Contact, and Free Consultation
pages have real content — and even those lack social proof, testimonials, and pricing details.

### Key Stats
- Pages with complete content: 6/15 (40%)
- Pages with placeholder/stub content: 5/15 (33%)  
- Pages with thin content: 4/15 (27%)
- Pages with real testimonials: 0/15 (0%)
- Pages with pricing info: 1/15 (partial — bookkeeping FAQ only)
- Blog posts with actual content: 1/3 (tax deadlines — still thin at ~180 words)

---

## PRIORITY 1: CRITICAL FIXES (Content that's hurting SEO/trust RIGHT NOW)

### 1.1 — Remove/noindex placeholder blog posts
**Files:** 
- `src/app/blog/ppn-pph-explained/page.tsx` — Says "This article is a placeholder"
- `src/app/blog/bookkeeping-best-practices/page.tsx` — Says "This article is a placeholder"
**Action:** Either write full content (1500+ words each) OR add `robots: { index: false }` metadata immediately to prevent Google from indexing thin/placeholder pages. Blog index claims "6 min read" and "5 min read" — these are lies that damage trust.
**Impact:** High — placeholder pages indexed by Google hurt domain authority

### 1.2 — Fix About page placeholder team data
**File:** `src/app/about/page.tsx`
**Current:** Team members show `name: "Lead Accountant"`, `credential: "Add credentials"` — literal placeholder text visible to users
**Action:** Replace with real team member names, credentials, photos, and bios. Add company story, mission, years of experience, certifications.
**Target word count:** 400-600 words
**Impact:** High — About page is critical for trust in professional services

### 1.3 — Write Privacy Policy (Legal compliance risk)
**File:** `src/app/privacy/page.tsx`
**Current:** "This is a placeholder privacy policy."
**Action:** Write real privacy policy covering: data collected via contact forms, cookies (GA4), consent management, Indonesia PDP Law compliance, GDPR considerations, data retention, user rights, third-party services
**Impact:** Critical — the site collects user data via forms + GA4 without a real privacy policy

### 1.4 — Write Terms of Service (Legal compliance risk)
**File:** `src/app/terms/page.tsx`  
**Current:** "This is a placeholder terms of service."
**Action:** Write real terms covering: service scope, payment terms, liability limitations, dispute resolution, governing law (Indonesian law), intellectual property
**Impact:** High — professional services business needs clear terms

### 1.5 — Fix Google Search Console verification
**File:** `src/app/layout.tsx`
**Current:** `verification: { google: "your-google-verification-code" }` — TODO placeholder
**Action:** Get actual Google Search Console verification code and replace
**Impact:** High — site may not be verified/monitored in Search Console

---

## PRIORITY 2: CONTENT THAT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY BOOST CONVERSIONS

### 2.1 — Add real testimonials / social proof across the site
**Files affected:** Homepage, Services pages, Free Consultation page
**Current:** "Outcomes we deliver" section uses fake testimonials with `name: "Monthly reporting clarity"` and `role: "Outcome focus"` — these are internal descriptions, NOT real client quotes
**Action:**
- Collect 3-6 real client testimonials with names, business names, and quotes
- Replace "Outcomes" section on homepage with real testimonials
- Add testimonial sections to service pages and free consultation page
- Add client logos if available
- Consider Google Reviews integration
**Impact:** Very High — #1 conversion gap. Professional services live and die by social proof

### 2.2 — Add pricing to service pages
**Files:**
- `src/app/services/bookkeeping/page.tsx` — Has "Pricing snapshot" section with tier names but NO actual prices (only Rp 1,500,000/month buried in FAQ)
- `src/app/services/tax-compliance/page.tsx` — Zero pricing info
- `src/app/services/page.tsx` — No pricing overview
**Action:**
- Add actual starting prices to bookkeeping pricing cards
- Add pricing or "starting from" to tax compliance page
- Consider a dedicated `/pricing` page with all tiers
**Impact:** High — price transparency increases trust and reduces friction

### 2.3 — Uncomment hero WhatsApp CTA
**File:** `src/components/sections/HeroCTA.tsx`
**Current:** The WhatsApp secondary CTA in the hero section is COMMENTED OUT
**Action:** Uncomment or restore the WhatsApp CTA button in the hero
**Impact:** Medium-High — the hero is the highest-visibility area; a second conversion path increases leads

### 2.4 — Build out "Coming Soon" service pages
**Files:**
- `src/app/services/payroll/page.tsx` — 2 lines of text, no CTA, no JSON-LD
- `src/app/services/initial-setup/page.tsx` — 2 lines of text, no CTA, no JSON-LD
**Action:** Either:
  a) Build full preview pages with: feature previews, expected benefits, email/WhatsApp waitlist CTA, FAQ, breadcrumbs, JSON-LD, OR
  b) Add `robots: { index: false }` and redirect to services index
**Impact:** Medium — thin pages hurt SEO; proper waitlist pages can capture leads

### 2.5 — Enhance Free Consultation page for conversion
**File:** `src/app/free-consultation/page.tsx`
**Current:** ~130 words, no social proof, no urgency, no trust signals
**Action:**
- Add testimonial/quote from a satisfied client
- Add trust badges (PKF Certified, Registered Tax Consultant)
- Add "100+ businesses served" or similar stat
- Add FAQ section addressing common objections
- Add urgency element ("Limited slots available this month")
**Target word count:** 300-500 words
**Impact:** High — this is the primary conversion page

---

## PRIORITY 3: SEO INFRASTRUCTURE FIXES

### 3.1 — Remove duplicate sitemap
**Files:**
- `public/sitemap.xml` — Static file (REMOVE)
- `src/app/sitemap.ts` — Dynamic generation (KEEP)
**Action:** Delete `public/sitemap.xml` to prevent conflict with the dynamically generated one
**Impact:** Medium — duplicate sitemaps can confuse crawlers

### 3.2 — Remove or fix SearchAction schema
**File:** `src/lib/schema.ts`
**Current:** WebSite schema includes SearchAction pointing to `/search?q=` — this page does NOT exist
**Action:** Remove the SearchAction from WebSite schema, or build a search page
**Impact:** Medium — misleading structured data can result in penalties

### 3.3 — Add missing JSON-LD schemas
**Files/Actions:**
- Service pages: Add `Service` or `ProfessionalService` schema (use existing `generateServiceSchema()` from `schema.ts` which is defined but never called)
- Blog posts: Add `Article`/`BlogPosting` schema (use existing `generateArticleSchema()` which is defined but never called)
- About page: Add `AboutPage` + `Organization` schema
- Contact page: Add `ContactPage` + `LocalBusiness` schema
**Impact:** Medium — improves rich snippet eligibility

### 3.4 — Create custom 404 page
**File to create:** `src/app/not-found.tsx`
**Action:** Build a branded 404 page with: helpful message, search/navigation links, CTA to contact or homepage
**Impact:** Low-Medium — improves UX for lost visitors

### 3.5 — Add security headers
**File:** `next.config.ts`
**Action:** Add `headers()` config with: X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Content-Security-Policy, Strict-Transport-Security
**Impact:** Low-Medium — security best practice, minor SEO signal

## PRIORITY 4: CONTENT MARKETING (Blog & SEO Content)

### 4.1 — Write full blog post: "PPh vs PPN: What's the Difference?"
**File:** `src/app/blog/ppn-pph-explained/page.tsx`
**Current:** Placeholder text
**Target:** 1500-2500 words covering:
- What is PPh (income tax) — types (PPh 21, 23, 25, 26, Final)
- What is PPN (VAT) — rates, thresholds, PKP registration
- Key differences in a comparison table
- Who pays what and when
- Common mistakes expats make
- How ReCounting helps
- Internal links to tax compliance service
- Add BlogPosting JSON-LD, author, datePublished
- FAQ section with FAQPage schema
**Impact:** High — this is a high-intent search query for the target audience

### 4.2 — Write full blog post: "Bookkeeping Best Practices for Bali SMEs"
**File:** `src/app/blog/bookkeeping-best-practices/page.tsx`
**Current:** Placeholder text
**Target:** 1500-2000 words covering:
- Why proper bookkeeping matters for Indonesian compliance
- Monthly bookkeeping checklist
- Common mistakes and how to avoid them
- Tools and software recommendations
- When to hire a professional bookkeeper
- How ReCounting's process works
- Internal links to bookkeeping service
- Add BlogPosting JSON-LD
**Impact:** Medium-High — targets informational keywords

### 4.3 — Update/expand tax deadlines blog post
**File:** `src/app/blog/tax-deadlines-indonesia-2024/page.tsx`
**Current:** ~180 words, no actual dates, title says "2024-2025" but it's 2026
**Action:**
- Update title/slug to 2026 (set up redirect from old URL)
- Add actual specific deadline dates in a table format
- Add penalty amounts for late filing
- Add regulatory references
- Add downloadable calendar CTA
- Expand to 1500+ words
- Add BlogPosting JSON-LD
**Impact:** High — tax deadline searches are seasonal high-intent queries

### 4.4 — New blog posts to consider (future content pipeline)
Recommended topics based on target audience (Bali SMEs + expats):
1. "How to Register a PT PMA in Bali: Complete Guide" (business setup)
2. "BPJS for Foreign Workers in Indonesia: What Employers Need to Know" (payroll)
3. "Annual SPT Filing Guide for Indonesian Businesses" (tax)
4. "Choosing an Accountant in Bali: What to Look For" (bottom-funnel)
5. "Indonesia Tax Changes 2026: What SMEs Need to Know" (topical)
6. "Cost of Doing Business in Bali: Complete Breakdown" (informational)

## PRIORITY 5: MISSING PAGES TO CONSIDER

### 5.1 — Dedicated Pricing Page (`/pricing`)
**Why:** Price transparency is a major conversion factor. Currently pricing is scattered/hidden. A dedicated page with clear tiers, feature comparisons, and FAQ would reduce friction.
**Recommended sections:** Tier comparison table, feature matrix, FAQ, "Book consultation for custom quote" CTA

### 5.2 — Case Studies / Success Stories page (`/case-studies`)
**Why:** Professional services need proof of results. Even 2-3 anonymized case studies showing before/after scenarios would massively boost conversion.
**Format:** Problem → Solution → Results with metrics

### 5.3 — FAQ/Knowledge Base page (`/faq`)
**Why:** Currently FAQs are scattered across individual pages (3 questions each). A comprehensive FAQ page would capture long-tail search traffic and reduce support inquiries.
**Target:** 15-25 questions covering all services, pricing, process, compliance topics

### 5.4 — Careers / Join Us page (`/careers`)
**Why:** As the business grows, a careers page signals stability and ambition. Optional/lower priority.

### 5.5 — Partners / Integrations page
**Why:** PKF partnership is mentioned but not expanded. Detailing partnerships and technology integrations builds credibility.
